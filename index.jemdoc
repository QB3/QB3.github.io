I am a post doctoral researcher at [https://mila.quebec/ Mila] working with [https://gauthiergidel.github.io/ Gauthier Gidel] and [https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/ Simon Lacoste-Julien].
\n
I work on the links between game theory and bilevel optimization.

Prior to this position, I did my Ph. D. at Inria Paris-Saclay
(in the [https://team.inria.fr/parietal/ Parietal Team]) under the supervision of [https://josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon] and [http://alexandre.gramfort.net/ Alexandre Gramfort].
\n
I worked on the optimization and statistical aspects of high dimensional sparse linear regression applied to brain signals reconstruction.
\n
In particular, I developped a python package for fast [https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm computation] and [https://github.com/QB3/sparse-ho automatic hyperparameter selection] of sparse linear models.

\n
Here is a short [./pdfs/Quentin_BERTRAND_CV.pdf resume] and my [research.html list of publications].
