== About me
I am a 2nd year PhD student in machine learning at Inria Paris-Saclay
(in the [https://team.inria.fr/parietal/ Parietal Team]), under the supervision of [https://josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon] and [http://alexandre.gramfort.net/ Alexandre Gramfort].
I work on the optimization and statistical aspects of high dimensional sparse linear regression applied to brain signals reconstruction.
I have a keen interest in the Python programming language: I am a contributor to
[https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html MNE].
I also develop a [https://github.com/QB3/CLaR python package] for high dimensional sparse linear regression with correlated noise.

\n
Here is a short [./pdf/CV_Quentin_Bertrand.pdf résumé] and my [research.html list of publications].
