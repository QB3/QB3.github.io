I am a 2nd year PhD student in machine learning at Inria Paris-Saclay
(in the [https://team.inria.fr/parietal/ Parietal Team]), under the supervision of [https://josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon] and [http://alexandre.gramfort.net/ Alexandre Gramfort].
\n
I work on the optimization and statistical aspects of high dimensional sparse linear regression applied to brain signals reconstruction.
I have a keen interest in coordinate descent algorithms ans in the Python programming language.
\n
I also develop  a [https://github.com/QB3/sparse-ho python package ] for automatic hyperparameter selection of sparse linear models.

\n
Here is a short [./pdfs/CV_Quentin_Bertrand.pdf resume] and my [research.html list of publications].
