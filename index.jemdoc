I am a 3rd year PhD student in machine learning at Inria Paris-Saclay
(in the [https://team.inria.fr/parietal/ Parietal Team]), under the supervision of [https://josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon] and [http://alexandre.gramfort.net/ Alexandre Gramfort].
\n
I work on the optimization and statistical aspects of high dimensional sparse linear regression applied to brain signals reconstruction.
I have a keen interest in coordinate descent algorithms, hyperparameter selection, and the Python programming language.
\n
I also develop  a [https://github.com/QB3/sparse-ho python package ] for fast automatic hyperparameter selection of sparse linear models.

\n
Here is a short [./pdfs/Quentin_BERTRAND_CV.pdf resume] and my [research.html list of publications].

\n
We are currently looking for interns to work on [./pdfs/internship_proposal.pdf bilevel optimization for hyperparameter setting] starting Spring 2021! Feel free to contact us.
