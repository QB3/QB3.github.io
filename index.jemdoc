Since July 1st, I am a junior tenured researcher (`chargé de recherche`) at [https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-lyon-centre Inria Lyon] and [https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html Université Jean Monnet], in the [https://labhc-malice.github.io/ Malice team], located in [https://laboratoirehubertcurien.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html Laboratoire Hubert Curien]. I teach at [https://www.ens-lyon.fr/ ENS Lyon].
I currently work on optimization and generative models.

From November 2021 to June 2024, I was a post-doctoral researcher at [https://mila.quebec/ Mila] working with [https://gauthiergidel.github.io/ Gauthier Gidel] and [https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/ Simon Lacoste-Julien].
Prior to this position, I did my Ph. D. at Inria Paris-Saclay
(in the [https://team.inria.fr/parietal/ Parietal Team]) under the supervision of [https://josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon] and [http://alexandre.gramfort.net/ Alexandre Gramfort].
I worked on the optimization and statistical aspects of high dimensional brain signal reconstruction.

In particular,
- We just released a [https://dl.heeere.com/conditional-flow-matching/blog/conditional-flow-matching/ friendly blog post] on normalizing flows and conditional flow matching techniques!
- Our recent works on [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00429.pdf self-consuming generative models] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09499 their biases] got [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/26/upshot/ai-synthetic-data.html media coverage from the N.Y. times]!
- We released a [https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm Python package for large scale optimization] of sparse problems ([https://pepy.tech/project/skglm 4k download/month]).
